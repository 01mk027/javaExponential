## Introduction and purpose
This basic project is developed for Java101 course on <a href="https://patika.dev">patika.dev</a>. Aim of the project is getting exponent of entered base number. Note that, base number and exponent number is entered by user via keyboard. A variable which is named as ```result``` is defined with initial value of 1. After getting required values from user, a for-loop is used for calculating ```result```. Upper limit of the for loop is exponent number. On the other hand, for loop iterate <i>exponent number</i> times. And inside for loop, for each iteration, ```result```, multiplies by <i>base number</i>.
